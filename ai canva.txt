remove overlay color on each section and make the background color as is

Perfect! I've removed all the overlay colors from the sections. Now every section uses the same dark background color (#0a0e27) for a clean, consistent look throughout the portfolio. The subtle cyan borders still separate the sections while maintaining that sleek tech aesthetic!


I DONT WANT TO SEE THE BOX ON THE IMAGE, I WILL PUT PNG IMAGES ON THE IMAGE PLACEHOLDER

Perfect! I've removed all the decorative boxes, backgrounds, borders, and glows from the image placeholders. Now you'll only see your PNG images when you add them, with no boxes or backgrounds visible. The images will display cleanly with just the floating animation on the hero image. Ready for your transparent PNG files!


MAKE THE FEATURE PROJECTS CARDS CLICKABLE ANYWHERE ON THE CARD

Perfect! The project cards are now fully clickable. When you click anywhere on a card, it will open the link in a new tab. The cursor also changes to a pointer when you hover over them to show they're interactive.

You can replace the # placeholder links with your actual project URLs when you're ready!
